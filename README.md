# Fantasy-Football



As an avid/loyal/obessive Fantasy Football player, I am always looking for an edge. Which is why I am attempting the possibly futiile  I'm trying to build a model that can predict "breakout" players in Fantasy Football. I scraped the data for the last 4 years from Fantasy Pros and than cleaned the data to try and remove outliers re Rookies, Players returning from injury etc. I started with Running Backs and will move to Wide Receivers and then Tight Ends. I will update this ReadMe to track my progress and update once I have moved on to the other positions.
